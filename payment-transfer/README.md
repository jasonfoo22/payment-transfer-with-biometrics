# Welcome to Payment Transfer Module Assessment ðŸ‘‹

This is a React Native project that demonstrates a simple payment transfer module. The module allows users to transfer money between accounts and view their transaction history.

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

3. Configuration options:
   ```bash
   Inside the mock folder:
    - Modify `mockData` to change the initial data and balances.
    - Adjust `mockAPI` to modify the success rate for the transfer API.
   ```

### Brief of this project
Since the assessment is focused on payment transfers, I decided to concentrate on the transfer functionality and transaction history. I've split the mock data into two parts (user and transaction) to better reflect real-world scenarios. While some of this data could be PII, it's presented as mock data for this demonstration.

### Technologies Used:
- State Management: Redux for managing global state.
- UI: React Native components styled for simplicity.
- Mock API: Simulates real API behavior with response success/failure cases.
